The next card in my GTD-mod system is the monthly calendar.  Since this is a more long-term card in the stack, it is a different color.  In my case, it is blue.  As things are processed that are not needed immediately, they go on the calendar to be remembered later.  The card is laid out with the month and year along the right side and a line along the left side.  As a new date is entered, the date number is put in the left column and the description right next to it.  This card is processed each week to put into the [weekly calendar](/gtd/2010/06/03/gtd-mod-weekly-calendar.html).

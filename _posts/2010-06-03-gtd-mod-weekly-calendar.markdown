Continuing the description of my modified [GTD](http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php), the second card in my stack contains the weekly calendar.  However, since I am not so good at drawing straight lines, I decided to use folded seams to mark the day lines.  I do this by creasing the card in half along the long direction, then creasing it in half along the short direction, then folding the two short ends down to the center crease.  The picture below shows the folding progression.

With the card folded, I label starting at the top left rectangle at Monday with the date below it and work down through the seven week days.  Since I usually make these cards on Sunday, I like to start the card with Monday so I am planning for the coming week.

Weekly Calendar Contents
------------------------
Although it is tempting to put things I want to get done on a certain day on the calendar, this weekly calendar is limited to hard deadlines.  This includes:
* meetings (with meeting time)
* due dates
* holidays/events

All of these things must be handled on that day, which is why they are on the calendar.  The bottom right corner is not used by a day so it can be used for things that need to be handled during the week but not on a particular day.

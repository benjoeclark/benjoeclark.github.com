![GTD-mod Projects and Someday](/images/gtd-mod-projects.png)

The last two cards in the stack are used to keep track of long term commitments.

Projects/Roles
--------------
The first is my projects/roles card.
Most things that require keeping track of come from having a role such as student, employee, family member, etc.
From these roles come specific projects that are a series of steps to achieve some goal.
Roles do not really have as definite a time that it can be considered complete so they go on the list with a box around them.
Often roles give rise to projects that need to be tracked so they can go underneath the role.
This card is referred to weekly or daily, as needed to see what needs to be accomplished on all active projects.

Someday
-------
The someday card is the place where projects and ideas go that you would like to keep out of your head but in the system.
This card is a catch-all of ideas and things you would like to do in your life.
Look at this one weekly during the review to see if it is time to kick one of the someday items into an active state.

I have been using my own implementation of [GTD](http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php) for about a month now and wanted to share it.  The use of index cards is inspired by the [hPDA](http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda) idea, which I like very much.  Rather than go through the entire system in one post, I will describe each card in my stack starting at the top and working down.

Actions
-------
The top card in the stack is my actions card.  An example is of this card is shown below.  This list is generated at the start of each day and anytime during the day that new actions need to be listed.  The actions list used to be the only list I made until I learned some tricks to keep things organized.  There are several requirements for a new action:
* the action is a single doable step, not a nebulous concept to keep track of
* the action has a context that determines when it can be performed
* if the action is part of a bigger list of actions, this [project]() must be tracked elsewhere

If an action is on the list for more than a couple of days, it needs to be evaluated to see why.  This action card is perhaps the most important part of using the system to actually get things done.

Contexts
--------
To keep me from having to look at each item on the actions list every time, each action has an icon at the start of the line.  The contexts that I use are:
* 0 - anywhere
* 1 - computer
* house - home
* desk - work
* \> - out (errand)
* cross - church

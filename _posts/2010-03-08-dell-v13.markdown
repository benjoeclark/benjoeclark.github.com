Just over a month ago, I received my [Dell v13](http://www.dell.com/us/en/business/notebooks/vostro-v13/pd.aspx?refid=vostro-v13&cs=04&s=bsd) with Ubuntu 9.10 preinstalled.  I was in the market for a netbook or ultraportable for school and came across [several](http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/08/dell-vostro-v13-hands-on-impressions-yes/) [announcements](http://gizmodo.com/5421997/dell-vostro-v13-hands-on-bruce-waynes-laptop) for the v13.

It met all of my requirements:
* light (about 3.5 lb)
* small (about the width and length of a small folder)
* battery life of at least 4 hours
* minimum resolution of 1366x768

And some of my wishes:
* Linux preinstalled
* thin (about 3/4 inch thick)

Below is my current setup with [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/) running the minimalist window manager [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/)

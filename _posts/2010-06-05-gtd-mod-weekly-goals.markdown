The last post described the [weekly calendar](/gtd/2010/06/023gtd-mod-weekly-calendar.html) that held deadlines for a week.  On the other side of that card is a list of active projects and goals for them during the same week.  Each day, both sides of this card are used to update the [actions](/gtd/2010/05/24/gtd-mod-actions.html) card.  If all actions have been completed, the project goals can be referenced and more actions generated.

Projects
--------
Projects in the [GTD](http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php) sense are things that need to be accomplished that require more than one action to be considered complete.  These projects are kept on an additional list until they are completed.  Projects that are active are placed on the weekly goals card along with a list of things to accomplish this week that move the project toward completion.

Weekly Goals Contents
------------------------
The projects are listed along the left side of the card.  Each goal is listed with a dot and then a description of the goal.  When a goal is completed, place a check on the dot.  It is important to include goals that are feasible to complete during a week.  Otherwise, this card is simply copied over every week.

Weekly Review
-------------
As a helpful habit, once a new weekly card is needed it is a good time to review the previous week.  This can be done by writing a report on what was accomplished and what did not get done.  Unfinished projects are moved to the next week and incomplete goals can be modified.  This is a good time to determine why a goal was not finished.  Were the expectations too high?  Did something come up that was more important?  Does this project need to be reconsidered?  Answering to yourself why a goal was missed helps refine the system.

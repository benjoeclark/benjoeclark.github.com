During the course of looking at [project goals](/gtd/2010/06/05/gtd-mod-weekly-goals.html), there may be some things that need to be done by someone else before progress can be made.  In this case, the person to do this step must be informed of the thing to be accomplished.  However, it is important not to lose track of that action.  Therefore, a waiting for card is used to track the actions that you depend on but cannot do yourself.

Waiting for Contents
--------------------
When an action assignment has been made that you depend on, write the name of the person along with the thing you are waiting for them to do.  It could be anything from finishing a review of a paper, getting a phone number, or anything that has a definite result.  It is also a good idea to write down the date that you made the assignment, along with any deadline dates.  When the action is completed, mark through the name and action and note the date that it was completed.  The waiting for card should be reviewed each day to determine if any action on your part is needed (such as a friendly reminder).
